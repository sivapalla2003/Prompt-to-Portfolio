## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User enters a short prompt or bio** (e.g., _"I’m an AI/ML engineer with a background in data science, passionate about building scalable solutions."_).
2. **Bolt AI interprets** and extracts structured information using optimized prompt engineering.
3. The backend sends formatted data to the frontend.
4. **Portfolio is rendered in real-time**, with editable sections, theme switcher, and export options.
